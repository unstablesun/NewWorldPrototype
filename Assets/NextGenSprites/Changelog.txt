Change log
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.9

[FIX]
* Changed shadowy shaders to write to the depth buffer,
  this allows Sprites to be positioned like 3D objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.8

[FIX]
* Alpha Channel on Liquid Shader

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.7

[FIX]
* Disabled Culling on FX Shaders
* Encoding Error on NGS.cginc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.6

[UPDATE]
* All Shaders can now be tinted by the SpriteRenderer Components color property.
  This is the same behavior as with Unity’s Standard Sprites which does not yield new Material
  Instances and reduces Draw Calls (i.e. preserves Batching).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.5

[UPDATE]
* Glass/Liquid: Added SpriteBlending Property
	|-> Note: Sprites may appear invisible, just ramp up alph back to 1

[FIX]
* Glass/Liquid: Screengrab is now properly tinted

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.4

[FIX]
* MegaStack: "_Layer4" Property redefinition error
* Android/Linux(?): nVIDIA CG to GLSL conversion could not perform implicit int to float casting

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.3

[FIX]
* Shadow casting works now properly on flipped and rotated Sprites
* Point/Spot Lights now do cast Shadows (before only Directional Lights were supported)
* Reduced Vertex-output register count

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.2

[NEW]
* Liquid Shader supports Render Textures
* Render Texture Shader Keyword for Liquid Shader

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.1

[NEW]
* Added Hue Shift with Hue, Saturation, Brightness and Contrast to all main Shaders
* HSB_TINT_ON is a new Shader feature which can be toggled from the Inspector
* _HSBC Vector4 property added to controll the Hue Shift feature

[UPDATE]
* New Icons for Inspector
* Inspector warns about Shadowy Shader restrictions
* Implemented NGS Base Class Shader library to simplify Shader Code

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3.0

[NEW]
* Added an additional Standard "Shadowy" Shader variation which can receive Shadows.
* Added MegaStack Shader. Based on Unlit shader and stacks up to 10 Sprites.

[UPDATE]
* Unlit now supports Curvature (fixed front directional)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2.2

[NEW]
* Added a Dual Material Class which allows to you lerp linear between two Materials float and color
  properties. This is especially useful for lerping with Tweening Engines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2.1

+++ Please Note +++
If you come from a previous Version, you may need to delete:
*NextGenSprites//Utils/Helpers/PropertiesCollectionManager.cs
*NextGenSprites//Utils/Helpers/PropertiesCollectionSoloManager.cs

[NEW]
* Added a method to update materials smoothly by a supplied duration to the Properties Collection
  Handler and Controller
  # since this method takes two arguments, you can't set it conveniently on a OnClick action for an
	GUI Button. Instead, you can use "UpdateMaterialByArguments" to parse arguments as strings.
	First comes the collection name and second the duration in seconds separated by a colon e.g.: "Idle:1.35"

[UPDATE]
* Renamed Scripts related to Properties Collection to be more explicit about their purpose
* Some simple custom inspectors for the Properties Collection Remote classes

[FIX]
* Errors when invoking some buttons on the extras Panel from the Material Inspector
* Preferences are now saved per Project and not global
* Several smaller bug fixes on Shaders and Scripts

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Create from or apply to a Material a Properties Collection directly from the Material Inspector
* Inherit from "Properties Collection Base" for basic Properties Collection handling via scripting
* Added a basic "Properties Collection Manager" to update the Material from AnimationEvents/Scripts/PlayMaker
	# Invoke: UpdateMaterial(collectionId)
* Multi Layer supports now Transparency without the need for a helper Mask
* Layers have now individual Tinting
* Added Stencil (RGB)Masking as a "Soft"-feature for Multi Layer
